# MuleSoft Developer Certification Level-1 prep. session


These are the Mule applications that I created for the class: MuleSoft training: DevFundamentals w/Mule-4.  These are used in demo'ing the concepts of Mule applicatons during the Level-1 Certification prep. session.

The solution files (starting with index 04) are built using:

- Anypoint Studio - 7.4.2

- Mule Server - 4.2.2 EE

## How to import solution .jar files into Studio?

- Download the solution .jar file

- Start **Anypoint Studio**

- **Note**: If the Studio's workspace already contains a project with the same name that you plan to import, right-click on the project and _delete_ it first (don't forget to select the _checkmark_ to delete it from the filesystem as well)

- Within **Package Explorer** section (top-left), right-click anywhere in white space, select **Import** to open the wizard

- Within **Import** wizard, exapand **Anypoint Studio > Packaged Mule application (jar)** and click **Next**

- Browse and select the .jar file that you downloaded, and click **Finish**

- Wait till all necessary dependencies are downloaded (progress is indicated at the bottom-right corner of Studio)

- That's it.  Now, you are ready to either add more content or run and test the mule app
